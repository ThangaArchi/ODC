# This file should be sourced (dotted) on all Hosting CPUs in the
# ctxsession.sh file, just below the setting of IP_ALL and IP_BASE
#
# The IP_ALL value is actually the company name. This file checks that
# the passed in company is listed in the hostingverify.file. This is a
# secondary check to prevent inappropriate access to a hosting box if
# a human error occurs when modifying the hmapping file.
#
# The actual filename/location for the HOSTINGVERIFYFILE and ERRORFILE
# are arbitrary, but the loginid for the user logging in must be able to
# read HOSTINGVERIFYFILE, and write ERRORFILE. The syntax for the
# HOSTINGVERIFYFILE is simply a list of company names which are allowed to
# login to the hosting CPU. Its probably a good idea to put IBM in this list
